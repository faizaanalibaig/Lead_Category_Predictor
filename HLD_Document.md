Creating a High-Level Design (HLD) document for this project involves outlining the project's architecture, components, and workflows. Here's a high-level design document tailored to our project:

**High-Level Design Document for LeadCategoryPredictor Project**

**1. Introduction**

The LeadCategoryPredictor project aims to analyze sales effectiveness and build a machine learning model to predict lead categories as either "High Potential" or "Low Potential." This HLD document provides an overview of the project's architecture and key components.

**2. Architecture Overview**

The project's architecture is divided into several components:

- Data Collection: Obtaining and importing the dataset containing sales and lead data.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performing data exploration to gain insights.
- Machine Learning Model Development: Training and evaluating ML models for lead category prediction.
- Model Deployment (Future Phase): Deploying the selected model for real-time lead categorization.

**3. Components**

**3.1. Data Collection**

- Data Source: Obtain the dataset containing sales and lead information.
- Data Import: Load the dataset into the project environment.

**3.2. Data Preprocessing**

- Handle Missing Values: Apply appropriate techniques (imputation, dropping) to address missing data.
- Encode Categorical Variables: Transform categorical features into numerical format for model compatibility.

**3.3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Univariate Analysis: Explore individual features to understand distributions and patterns.
- Bivariate Analysis: Investigate relationships between features, including product IDs, sources, sales agents, locations, and delivery modes.
- Identify Duplicate Records: Detect and address duplicate entries.

**3.4. Machine Learning Model Development**

- Data Splitting: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Model Selection: Choose appropriate classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Model Training: Train selected models on the training dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Select the Best Model: Choose the best-performing and most generalized model for lead category prediction.

**3.5. Model Deployment (Future Phase)**

- Deploy the selected model for real-time lead categorization.
- Integrate the model into a production environment or web application.

**4. Conclusion**

The LeadCategoryPredictor project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of a machine learning model to predict lead categories. The project's high-level design outlines the architecture and key components required for successful lead category prediction.

This HLD document serves as a guide for project development and provides a roadmap for implementing and deploying the lead categorization model.

**Note:** Detailed technical specifications, algorithms, and code implementation details are typically provided in separate ipynb file sections of the project repository.
